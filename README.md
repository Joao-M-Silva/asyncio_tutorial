# Python Asyncio Tutorial
This repository is a simple asyncio tutorial. Asyncio is a python stardard library used to write concurrent code using the async/await syntax.
Running code concurrently is beneficial since it allows to start running some code even though some previous task is not finished yet. 
Please note that asynchronicity is single threaded and don't use multiple CPU cores. We are not executing multiple tasks in parallel, which is the case for multihreading and multiprocessing.
